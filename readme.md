# AoC 2016 in rust

I was trying to find some challanges to work on to improve my rust skills,
and this was basically the most fun thing for me to do.

I didn't make any CLI or anything similar so if you want to run it replace the day and part number with the one you want to solve.

```rust
day01::part1::solve().expect("invalid input");
```

If you want your own input replace `input.txt` with your input and recompile.

### My thoughts on each day

A bit of text describing my expierence with creating a solution for a specefic day.

* day 1: A lot of small bugs today, mostly type mismatches with different types of ints, understandable but annoying

Thanks for reading!
