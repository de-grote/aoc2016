# AoC 2016 in rust

I was trying to find some challanges to work on to improve my rust skills,
and this was basically the most fun thing for me to do.

I chose 2016 specifically since I have already done most of 2021 and 2015 in python.

I might try to finish those one day but that's neither here nor there.

I'm also going to _try_ and finish all this year but I expect it to become really difficult to make an algorithm that finishes in a reasonable amount of time (multiple minutes) around day 20.

### Run

I didn't make any CLI or anything similar so if you want to run it replace the day and part number with the one you want to solve.

```rust
day01::part1::solve().expect("invalid input");
```

If you want your own input replace `input.txt` with your input and recompile.

### My thoughts on each day

A bit of text describing my expierence with creating a solution for a specefic day.

* day 1: A lot of small bugs today, mostly type mismatches with different types of ints, understandable but annoying.

* day 2: It honestly took me way to long to make the HashMap because of all the braces, went pretty smoothly apart from that though.

* day 3: Pretty fun, went smoothly, too bad my solution for part 2 is a _bit_ verbose, but its pretty fast so its fine.
